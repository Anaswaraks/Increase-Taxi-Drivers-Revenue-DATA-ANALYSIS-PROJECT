# Increase-Taxi-Drivers-Revenue-DATA-ANALYSIS-PROJECT

This project focuses on the taxi booking sector, where maximizing revenue is crucial for both driver success and customer satisfaction.
The goal is to use data-driven insights to determine whether payment methods, such as card or cash, impact fare amounts. By understanding this relationship, we aim to help drivers optimize their revenue streams without negatively affecting the customer experience.

Domain :
This project belongs to the data analytics and transportation domain.
We’re analyzing taxi trip data to uncover patterns and trends in customer behavior, specifically focusing on how payment types influence fare amounts.
The insights from this analysis can be applied to improve revenue strategies for taxi drivers and enhance operational efficiency in the transportation industry.

Tech Stack:
For this project, I used a combination of data analysis and statistical tools.
The primary technologies include:

Python for data cleaning and analysis,

Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation,

Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization, and

SciPy for hypothesis testing.
The dataset used is the NYC Taxi Trip Records, which provides comprehensive information on passenger counts, payment types, fare amounts, and trip distances

 I’ve completed the data cleaning and feature engineering process, focusing on relevant columns like payment type, fare amount, and trip distance.
I’ve also conducted exploratory data analysis and hypothesis testing(T-test), which revealed that customers paying with cards tend to have higher average fares compared to cash payments.
